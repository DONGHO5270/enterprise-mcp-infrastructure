# 🚀 Path Independence Guide - Clone Anywhere, Run Everywhere

## 📋 Overview

This infrastructure now supports **complete path independence**. Users can clone the repository to any location on their system, and everything will work automatically without any manual path configuration.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Automatic Path Detection
- Scripts automatically detect the project root directory
- No need to edit configuration files
- Works on Windows, WSL, Linux, and macOS

### 🔄 Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Automatic path conversion between Windows and Unix formats
- WSL path handling (C:\ ↔ /mnt/c/)
- Docker volume mounting with correct path formats

### 📦 Zero Configuration
- Clone → Run setup → Start using
- No manual path editing required
- Environment variables generated automatically

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Windows Users (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Clone to ANY location
git clone https://github.com/DONGHO5270/enterprise-mcp-infrastructure.git C:\MyProjects\mcp

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd C:\MyProjects\mcp

# Run smart setup (auto-detects everything)
.\smart-setup.ps1

# Start the infrastructure
.\start-mcp.bat
```

### Linux/WSL/macOS Users
```bash
# Clone to ANY location
git clone https://github.com/DONGHO5270/enterprise-mcp-infrastructure.git ~/projects/mcp

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd ~/projects/mcp

# Run smart setup (auto-detects everything)
./smart-setup.sh

# Start the infrastructure
./start-mcp.sh
```

## 📁 How It Works

### 1. Project Root Detection
The scripts look for `CLAUDE.md` file to identify the project root:
```javascript
// Searches up to 10 directories up from current location
// Falls back to current directory if not found
ProjectRoot = FindProjectRootByClaudeMd()
```

### 2. Path Conversion
Automatically converts paths for Docker compatibility:
- Windows: `C:\Users\name\project` → `/mnt/c/Users/name/project`
- WSL: Detects and handles both Windows and Linux paths
- Docker: Uses Unix-style paths in volumes

### 3. Dynamic Configuration Generation
Creates configuration files with detected paths:
```env
PROJECT_ROOT=/detected/project/path
DATA_PATH=/detected/project/path/data
LOG_PATH=/detected/project/path/logs
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Force Regeneration
If you move the project or want to regenerate configs:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\smart-setup.ps1 -Force
```

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
./smart-setup.sh --force
```

### Manual Path Override
Set environment variable before running setup:

**Windows:**
```powershell
$env:MCP_PROJECT_ROOT = "D:\CustomPath\mcp"
.\smart-setup.ps1
```

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
export MCP_PROJECT_ROOT="/custom/path/mcp"
./smart-setup.sh
```

## 📊 Supported Scenarios

| Scenario | Windows | WSL | Linux | macOS |
|----------|---------|-----|-------|-------|
| Default user directory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom directory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Different drive (D:, E:) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| Network path | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Symbolic links | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Spaces in path | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Project root not found"
**Solution:** Ensure `CLAUDE.md` exists in the project root
```bash
# Check if CLAUDE.md exists
ls CLAUDE.md
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x smart-setup.sh
chmod +x start-mcp.sh
chmod +x stop-mcp.sh
```

### Issue: "Docker paths not working in WSL"
**Solution:** Ensure Docker Desktop has WSL2 integration enabled
1. Open Docker Desktop settings
2. Go to Resources → WSL Integration
3. Enable integration with your WSL distro

### Issue: "Paths with spaces causing errors"
**Solution:** The scripts handle spaces automatically, but ensure you're using the latest version
```bash
git pull origin main
./smart-setup.sh --force
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Individual Developers
- ✅ Clone to your preferred directory structure
- ✅ No need to modify any configuration files
- ✅ Works immediately after cloning

### For Teams
- ✅ Each team member can use their own directory structure
- ✅ No conflicts from hardcoded paths
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different environments

### For CI/CD
- ✅ Works in any build directory
- ✅ No path-related build failures
- ✅ Easy integration with various CI systems

## 📈 Migration from Old Setup

If you have an existing installation with hardcoded paths:

1. **Backup your data**
   ```bash
   cp -r data data.backup
   cp -r logs logs.backup
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Run smart setup**
   ```bash
   ./smart-setup.sh --force  # or .\smart-setup.ps1 -Force on Windows
   ```

4. **Restart services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Path Detection Algorithm
1. Check for `CLAUDE.md` in current directory
2. Search parent directories (up to 10 levels)
3. Check for `.git` directory as secondary indicator
4. Fall back to current directory if not found
5. Validate with Docker and directory existence

### Cross-Platform Path Handling
- **Windows → Docker:** Replace backslashes, add `/mnt/c/` prefix
- **WSL → Docker:** Use native paths, detect Windows mounts
- **Linux/macOS → Docker:** Use paths as-is

### Environment Variable Priority
1. User-set `MCP_PROJECT_ROOT`
2. Auto-detected from `CLAUDE.md`
3. Current working directory

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Run smart-setup script after cloning
- Use the generated start/stop scripts
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` in the project root
- Pull latest changes regularly

### ❌ DON'T
- Manually edit generated `.env` files
- Move project without re-running setup
- Hardcode paths in custom scripts
- Commit generated environment files

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

The path independence system is designed to be forward-compatible:
- New features will maintain path independence
- Setup scripts will be updated automatically
- Backward compatibility is maintained

To update your setup:
```bash
git pull origin main
./smart-setup.sh  # Regenerates with latest improvements
```
